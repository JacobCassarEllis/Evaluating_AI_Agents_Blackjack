# Evaluating_AI_Agents_Blackjack
Game AI Assignment focusing on Evaluating multiple AI Agents to solve the BlackJack problem.

The project involves evaluating three AI Algorithms (Evolutionary Neural Network, Q-Learning and Genetic Algorithm) customly implemented into sovling the blackjack problem.
The project provides a unity gameplayable simulation where one can either play against the dealer or test other the AI agents themselves
against the dealer.

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world. It involves comparing cards between the players and the dealer. In this research, we implemented a number of AI agents adapted from several machine learning techniques that could solve the Blackjack problem. Each algorithm is designed to approximate the most optimal strategy which dictates what action should be taken given a particular game state so as to maximise winning likelihood. The three algorithms implemented are Q-Learning, an evolutionary algorithm and an evolutionary neural network. Whereas typical studies conducted in the domain focus mainly on three legal actions; hitting, standing and doubling-down, our contributionalsoconsiderssplittingasthisactionisallowedinmost casino variations of Blackjack. The aforementioned algorithms are also compared against each other to see which one performs best. Finally, the knowledge learnt by the AI agents was transferred into aUnity-basedBlackjacksimulationsoastoallowtheusertoseein real-time the decisions taken by the agent given a particular game state.
