The project involves evaluating three AI Algorithms (Evolutionary Neural Network, Q-Learning and Genetic Algorithm) customly implemented into sovling the blackjack problem.
The project provides a unity gameplayable simulation where one can either play against the dealer or test other the AI agents themselves
against the dealer.

Credits goes to my colleagues Jake Seracino, David Vella, Jacob Cassar Ellis, and Mark Bugeja for their collaboration.
